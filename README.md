### New branch creation from VS code

Key-In `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and search for `Git: Create Branch` Once you selected the option, the prompt will ask for the branch name.

Once the branch name is entered, a new branch will be created from the base branch.

Then make all necessary changes to the files and we can proceed to commit and push.
